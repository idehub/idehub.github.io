**Google Analytics Bridge** is built to provide an easy interface to the native Google Analytics libraries on both **iOS** and **Android**.

You get a lot of the metadata handled automatically by the Google Analytics native library over the Javascript library. This will include the device UUID, device model, viewport size, OS version etc.
